# Stats 5100: Modern Regression Techniques 

In this lecture we will cover some common techniques for model selection. 
We will use the `learnr` package in the `R` programming language. 
To be able to run this document on your own computer, you will need the following: 

- A recent version of `R` installed. 
- Rstudio installed. 
- The `learnr` package installed, which can be installed using: 

```
